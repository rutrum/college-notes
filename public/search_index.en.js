expansions$\\}$\n\n\nComplex: $\\mathbb C = \\{a + bi : a,b \\in \\mathbb R, i^2 = -1\\}$\n\n\nFunctions\nDefinition\nFor a function $f : A \\rightarrow B$, $f$ is the function name, $A$ is\nthe domain, and $B$ is the codomain.\nMapping\nFor a function $f : a \\mapsto b$, we say that $f$ maps $a \\in A$ to\n$b \\in B$.\nImage\nThe image of a function is the set of all outputs of the function.\nThis is also known as the range.\nPreimage and Fiber\nThe preimage of a function is the set of all inputs to the function.\nThe fiber of a value is the set of inputs that map to that value.\nInjectivity\nLet $f$ be injective if for all $a, b$, then $f(a) = f(b)$ implies\n$a = b$. We also say $f$ is one-to-one.\nSurjectivity\nLet $f$ be surjective if for all elements in the codomain, there\nexists an element in the domain that maps to it. We also say $f$ is\nonto.\nBijectivity\nLet $f$ be bijective if it is both injective and surjective.\nEquivalence Relations\nDefinition\nLet $a$ be related $b$, denoted $a \\sim b$ . Then $a \\sim b$ is an\nequivalence relation if and only if the following are true:\n\n\nReflexivity: $a \\sim a$\n\n\nSymmetry: $a \\sim b \\implies b \\sim a$\n\n\nTransitivity: $(a \\sim b) \\wedge (b \\sim c) \\implies a \\sim c$\n\n\nWe say that $a$ is equivalent to $b$.\nIntegers Modulo $n$\nDefine $a \\sim b$ only if $a \\equiv b \\pmod n$. Define\n$\\mathbb Z/n\\mathbb Z$ to be the set of $n$ distinct integers $a_i &gt; 0$\nsuch that $a_i \\sim i$ for $0 \\leq i &lt; n$. We call\n$\\mathbb Z/n\\mathbb Z$ the set of integers modulo $n$. Every $a_i$\nrepresents a single value from a residue class. The least value of\nthese $a_i$ is called the least residue.\nIntegers Modulo $n$ Cross\nDefine $(\\mathbb Z/n\\mathbb Z)^\\times$ to be the set of all elements of\n$\\mathbb Z/n\\mathbb Z$ with multiplicative inverses.

Thus, $|Hg_1| = |Hg_2|$.\nLaGrange Theorem\nLet $H$ be a subgroup of $G$, then $|G| = |H| \\cdot |G/H|$.\nIndex\nThe index of $H$ in $G$ is $|G/H|$.\nNormal Subgroup\nA subgroup $H$ of $G$ is called a normal subgroup of $G$, denoted\n$H \\triangleleft G$, if $ghg\\inv \\in H$ for all $g \\in G$ and for all\n$h \\in H$. We say that $H$ is closed under conjugation by the elements\nin $G$.\nFunctions Between Groups\nLet $G_1$ and $G_2$ be groups with identity elements $e_1$ and $e_2$\nrespectively. A function $f: G_1 \\rightarrow G_2$ is called a group\nhomomorphism if $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$ for $a, b$. A one-to-one\nhomomorphism is called a monomorphism. An onto homomorphism is called\na epimorphism. A one-to-one and onto homomorphism is called an\nisomorphism.\n$f(ab)=f(a)f(b)$Not 1-11-1\nNot OntoHomomorphismMonomorphism\nOntoEpimorphismIsomorphism\n\nImage and Kernal\nLet $f: G_1 \\rightarrow G_2$ be a homomorphism. Then the image of\n$G_1$: $f(G_1) = \\{f(x): x\\in G\\}$ is a subgroup of $G_2$. It also\nfollows that the kernal of $f$:\n$\\text{ker} f = \\{x \\in G_1: f(x) = e_2\\}$ is a normal subgroup of\n$G_1$.\nPointwise Product\nDefine the pointwise product of two subset $A$ and $B$ of a group $G$\nby $A \\cdot B = \\{ab: a \\in A, b\\in B\\}$.\nNormality and Cosets\nLet $H \\triangleleft G$. Then for any $x,y \\in G$, $Hx = xH$ and\n$Hx \\cdot Hy = Hxy$.\nFirst Homomorphism Theorem\nLet $G_1, G_2$ be groups and let $f: G_1 \\rightarrow G_2$ be an onto\nhomomorphism with kernal $K$. Then $G_2$ is isomorphic to $G_1/K$.\nPermutation Group\nDefine $S(X)$ as the set of all permutations of elements in set $S$. Let\n$S_n$ be the set of all permutations of elements in the set\n$\\{1,2,3,\\dots,n\\}$. We call $S_n$ the symmetric group of degree $n$.\nAlternating Group\nDefine $A_n$, called the alternating group, as the set of all even\npermutations of $S_n$. Note that $A_n$ is normal in $S_n$.\nConjugacy\nAn element $a \\in G$ is said to be a conjugate in $G$ of an element\n$b$ if there exists an $x \\in G$ such that $a = xbx\\inv$.\nConjugacy Classes\nConjugacy is an equivalence relation on $G$, and thus, the action\npartitions the group $G$ into conjugacy classes.\nConjugacy of Permutations\nFor two elements $a, b \\in S_n$, $a$ and $b$ are in the same conjugacy\nclass if and only if they have the same cycle decomposition. It follows\nthat the number of conjugacy classes in $S_n$ equals the number of\npartitions of $n$.\nRings\nRing Axioms\nA set $R$ with two operations defined on it called addition and\nmultiplication (denoted by $+$ and $\\cdot$ respectively) is called a\nring if the following are true.\n\n\n$R$ is an abelian group under addition.\n\n\n$R$ is closed and is associative under multiplication\n\n\nThe distributive laws hold: $a(b+c) = ab+ac$ and $(a+b)c = ac + bc$.\n\n\nCommutative Ring\nA ring $R$ is called commutative if multiplication on $R$ is\ncommutative: $ab = ba$.\nIdentities\nRings have a additive identity that follows from being a group under\naddition. We denoted this identity as 0. Rings do not necessarily have\nan identity under multiplication, a value $u \\neq 0$ such that\n$u \\cdot x = x$ for all $x \\in R$. If they do, we denote that identity\nas the unity, or 1.\nSubring\nA subset $T$ of ring $R$ is called a subring if $T$ is a ring under\nthe operations defined on $R$.\nIdeal\nA subring $T$ of $R$ is called an ideal if for all $x \\in R$ and\n$t \\in T$, then $xt \\in T$.\nSmallest Ideal\nThe smallest ideal of $R$ containing a given subset $A$ of $R$ is\ndenoted by $(A)$.\nPrinciple Ideal\nThe ideal generated by a single element $a \\in R$ is denoted by $(a)$ is\ncalled a princicple ideal in $R$.\nMaximal Ideal\nAn ideal $I$ of $R$ is called a maximal ideal of $R$ if $I \\subset R$\nand there is no ideal $J$ of $R$ such that $I \\subset J \\subset R$.\nRing Homomorphisms\nLet $R_1$ and $R_2$ be commutative rings. A function\n$f: R_1 \\rightarrow R_2$ is called a ring homomorphism if $a, b \\in R_1$\nimplies that $f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b)$ and $f(ab) = f(a)f(b)$. Similar\nterms for group homomorphisms are analagous here.\nKernal\nKernals of rings are defined similarly.\nFirst Isomorphism Theorem for Rings\nLet $R$ and $S$ be rings and let $f:R\\rightarrow S$ be an onto ring\nhomomorphism with kernal $K$. Then $R/K$ is isomorphic to $S$.\nUseful Factorings On Rings\nLet $a, b$ be elements in ring $R$. Then the following statements hold\nfor $n \\in \\mathbb N$. $$\\begin{aligned}\n(a+b)^n &amp;= \\sum_{k=0}^n \\binom{n}{k}a^{n-k}b^k \\\na^n-b^n &amp;= (a-b)\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}a^{n-1-k}b^k \\\na^n+b^n &amp;= (a+b)\\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}(-1)^ka^{n-1-k}b^k &amp;\\text{if $n$ is odd} \n\\end{aligned}$$\nFields\nField Axioms\nA field $F$ is a commutative ring with unity (identity under\nmultiplication) in which the nonzero elements form a group under\nmultiplication.\nSubfield\nA subset $S$ of field $F$ is called a subfield of $F$ it is a field\nunder the operations on $F$.\nPrime Subfield\nThe intersections of all subfields is called the prime subfield of\n$F$, the smallest subfield of $F$.\nAutomorphism\nA one-to-one function $g$ from a field $F$ onto $F$ is called an\nautomorphism of $F$ if is a one-to-one ring homomorphism of $F$ onto\nitself.\nIntegral Domains\nDefinition\nAn integral domain $D$ is a commutative ring with at least two\nelements such that $x,y \\in D$ and $xy = 0$, then $x = 0$ or $y = 0$.\nGaussian Integers\nDefine the guassian integers as the set\n$\\{a + ib: a, b \\in \\mathbb Z\\}$.\nZero Divisor\nAn element $x$ of a commutative ring $R$ is called a zero divisor in\n$R$ if $x \\neq 0$ and if there is a nonzero $y \\in R$ for which\n$xy = 0$.\nFields are Integral Domains\nAll fields are integral domains. Not all integral domains are fields.\nCharacteristic\nThe characteristic of an integral domain $S$ is the smallest positive\ninteger $m$ such that\n$\\underbrace{x + x + \\dots + x}_\\text{$m$ times} = m \\cdot x = 0$ for\nall $x \\in S$. If no such positive integer exists, the characteristic of\n$S$ is defined to be 0.\nCharacteristics are Prime\nThe characteristic of an integral domain must either be 0 or prime.\nSummary of Algebraic Structures\n$$\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Groups} &amp;\\subset \\text{Abelian Groups} \\\n&amp;\\subset \\text{Rings} \\\n&amp;\\subset \\text{Commutative Rings} \\\n&amp;\\subset \\text{Integral Domains} \\\n&amp;\\subset \\text{Fields} \\\n\\end{aligned}$$\nIntegral Domains with Unity\nUnit\nA unit is an element that has a multiplicative inverse.\nAssociates\nTwo elements $a, b \\in D$ are called associates in $D$ if there exists\na unit $u \\in D$ such that $a = bu$.\nDivides on a Domain\nThe relation $a | b$ between elements in $D$ have the following\nproperties:\n\n\nIf $a|b$ and $b|c$, then $a | c$.\n\n\nIf $a|b$ and $a|c$, then $a | (b \\pm c)$.\n\n\nIf $a|b$, then $a|bx$ for all $x \\in D$\n\n\nGreatest Common Divisor\nAn element $d$ is called the greatest common divisor of $a$ and $b$ if\nfor any element that divides $a$ and $b$, it also divides $d$.\nPartitioning Integral Domains with Unity\nPartition an integral domain $D$ into three groups:\n\n\n$\\{0\\}$\n\n\nUnits in $D$\n\n\nAll other elements denoted $\\hat D$.\n\n\nReducible\nAn element $a \\in D$ is said to be reducible in $D$ if $a \\in \\hat D$\nand if there exists $b, c \\in \\hat D$ such that $a = bc$. Element\n$a \\in D$ is said to be irreducible if it is not reducible.\nPrime\nElement $x \\in D$ is called prime in $D$ if for any $y, z \\in S$ such\nthat $x|yz$, then either $x|y$ or $x|z$.\nUnique Factorization Domain\nDomain $D$ is called a unique factorization domain or UFD if any\n$x \\in \\hat D$ can be written as the finite product of irreducible\nelements that are unique up to associates.\nMultiplicative Norm\nA function $\\eta: D \\rightarrow \\mathbb Z$ is called a multiplicative\nnorm on $D$ if the following conditions are satisfied for $x, y \\in D$.\n\n\n$\\eta(x) \\geq 0$\n\n\n$\\eta(x) = 0$ if and only if $x = 0$\n\n\n$\\eta(xy) = \\eta(x)\\eta(y)$\n\n\nNorm of Unity is 1\n$\\eta(1) = 1$.\nNorms of Associates\nIf $x$ and $y$ are associates then $\\eta(x) = \\eta(y)$.\nSome Elements Aren't Just Irreducible\nA prime element of an integral domain $D$ is irreducible.\nIrreducibles of UFDs\nEvery irreducible element of a unique factorization domain is prime.\nPrinciple Ideal Domain\nAn integral domain is called a principal ideal domain if any ideal of\nthe domain is a principal ideal.\nField Extensions\nDefinition\nLet $K$ be a subfield of $L$. Then we say that $L$ is an extension of\n$K$, and is notated as $L : K$.\nDegree\nIf $L : K$, then $L$ is a vector space over $K$ and its dimension over\n$K$, denoted as $[L : K]$, is called the degree of $L$ over $K$. If\nthe degree is finite, we call $L$ is a finite extension.\nExtension on a Field\nWe define $F(A)$ for a field $F$ to be the set of all elements in $F$,\nthe set of all elements in $A$, and all the elements forced by their\nunion. If $A$ is a single element, we say that $F(A)$ is a simple\nextension.\nSimple and Finite Extentions\nIt turns out that every finite extension is a simple extension. But note\nthat not every simple extension is finite, for example: $Q(\\pi)$.\nTower Law\nSuppose $M : L$ and $L : K$ are finite field extensions. Then\n$$[M:K]=[M:L]\\cdot[L:K].$$\nExtended Tower Law\nThe tower law can be extended to any number of field extensions. The\nsequences of field extensions is called a tower of field extensions.\nAlgebraic Degree\nAn element $a \\in L$ is said to be algebraic of degree $n$ over $K$ if\nthere is a polynomial $p(x)$ in $K[x]$ of degree $n$ such that\n$p(a) = 0$, and if no nonzero polynomial of lower degree in $K[x]$ has\nthis property.\nMinimial Polynomial\nIf $p(x)$ is a monic with the above property, then it is called the\nminimal polynomial for $\\alpha$ over $K$.\nTranscendental\nIf no polynomial $p(x)$ exists for such $a$, then we said that $a$ is\ntranscendental over $K$.\nTests for Irreducibility\nImportant Facts Before We Start\n\n\nThe set $D[x]$ of the polynomials over $D$ is itself an integral\ndomain.\n\n\nThe set of units of $D[x]$ is the same as that of $D$.\n\n\nIf $D$ is a UFD, then so is $D[x]$.\n\n\nIf $F$ is a field, then the set of irreducible polynomials in $F[x]$\ncontains all the first degree polynomials in $F[x]$.\n\n\nA Word on Irreducibility\nNote that determining if a given polynomial is irreducible depends on\nthe polynomial domain in which it is being considered.\nPrimitive\nA nonzero polynomial in $Z[x]$ is called primitive if the greatest\ncommon divisor of its coefficients is $1$.\nProduct of Primitives\nThe product of two primitive polynomials is primitive.\nOne More Fact\nA primitive polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb Z$ if and only if a\nconstant multiple of that polynomial is reducible over $\\mathbb Q$.\nGauss's Lemma\nIf a primitive polynomial can be factored as a product of two\npolynomials having rational coefficients, then it can be factored as a\nproduct of two polynomials with integer coefficients.\nThe Eisenstein Criterian\nIf a prime divides all non-leading coefficients of a polynomial, does\nnot divide the leading coefficient, and the square of the prime does not\ndivide the constant term, then the polynomial is irreducible over the\nrationals.\nAnother Fact\nA polynomial of the form $x^{p-1} + x^{p-2} + \\dots + x + 1$ for some\nprime $p$ is irreducible over $\\mathbb Z$.\nConstructable Numbers\nDefinition\nSuppose we are given a straight-edge, a compass, and two distinct points\n$A$ and $B$ whose distance we call unit length. We call a real number\n$\\alpha$ constructable if one can construct a line segment of length\n$|\\alpha|$ in a finite number of steps from unit length using only a\nstraight-edge and compass.\nConstructable Point\nWe call point $(a,b)$ in the Euclidean plane a constructable point if\nand only if $|a|$ and $|b|$ are constructable numbers.\nIt's a Field\nThe constructable numbers form a field that contains $\\mathbb Q$ as a\nsubfield.\nIt's Not Just Rationals\nIf $\\alpha$ is constructable, then so is $\\sqrt{|\\alpha|}$.\nBut Not All Reals\nCube roots are not constructable. Geometrically, this means you cannot\ntrisect an angle.\nSplitting Fields\nSplit\nLet $L:K$ be an extension. A polynomial $f(x) \\in K[x]$ is said to split\nover $L$ if we can write $f(x) = a(x-\\alpha_1)\\dots(x-\\alpha_n)$ where\n$a\\in K$ and $\\alpha_i \\in L$. Then $L:K$ is called a splitting field\nextension for $f$ if $f$ splits over $L$ and if there exists no proper\nsubfield of $L$ containing $K$ such that $f$ splits over that subfield.\nThe Exact Extension\nSuppose $L:K$ is an extension and $f \\in K[x]$ splits over $L$ as\n$f(x) = a(x-\\alpha_1)\\dots(x-\\alpha_n)$. Then\n$K(\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n)$ is a splitting field extension for\n$f(x)$.\nSimple Extensions Mean Reducible\nSuppose $f \\in K[x]$ is irreducible of degree $n \\geq 1$. Then there\nexists a simple algebraic extension $K(\\alpha) : K$ such that\n$[K(\\alpha):K] = n$ and $f(\\alpha) = 0$ for some $\\alpha = L$.\nRandom Fact From Notes\nFor any prime $p$, there exists a field of order $p^n$ for any\n$n \\in \\mathbb N$.\nRoots of Unity and Cyclotomic Polynomials\nRoots of Unity\nLet $p(x) = x^n - 1$. Applying De Moivre's Theorem we find the complex\nroots to $p(x)$ to be\n$$\\frac{\\cos 2k\\pi}{n} + \\frac{i\\sin 2k\\pi}{n} = \\exp{\\frac{2\\pi ik}{n}}, 1 \\leq k \\leq n.$$\nWe can write these roots as $a, a^2, a^3, \\dots, a^{n-1}, a^n = 1$ for\n$a = \\exp{\\frac{2\\pi ik}{n}}$.\nRoots Make Group\nThe roots of unity form a cyclic group $C_n$ of order $n$. One can\npartition $C_n$ into $\\delta(n)$ classes, where two elements are the in\nsame class if and only if they have the same order in $C_n$.\nCyclotomic Polynomials\nThe $n^{th}$ cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_n(x)$ is defined as\n$$\\Phi_n(x) = \\prod_\\epsilon (x-\\alpha)$$ where the product is taken\nover all primitive $n^{th}$ roots of unity. As a consequence of\npartitioning $C_n$, it follows that $$x^n-1 = \\prod_{m|n}\\Phi_m(x).$$\nGalois Group of a Polynomial\nSet of Automorphisms\nLet $L : K$ be a field extension and let $\\Gamma(L:K)$ denote the set of\nall automorphisms $\\sigma$ of $L$ such that for all $x \\in K$,\n$\\sigma(x) = x$. In other words, all the automorphism of $L$ that fix\nelements of $K$.\nGalois Group\nThe set $\\Gamma(L:K)$ is a group under function composition.
