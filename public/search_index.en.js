into fewer bits by representing each\ncharacter by a smaller number of bits. Fixed length compression ensures\nthat these replacement bit patterns, called prefix codes, are of the\nsame length.\nVariable Length Compression\nThe replacement bit patterns can also be done in different lengths. To\nensure that the string can be decoded unambiguously, a specific set of\nprefix codes must be chosen.\nPrefix Tree\nPrefix codes can be represented as a prefix tree. When no one bit\npattern is the subset of another (on the tree) then the prefix codes\nrepresent compression that can be decoded.\nOptimal Compression\nA problem that can be solved: find the optimal prefix code to represent\na given string $T$ composed of symbols from alphabet $A$.

Then $L:K$ is called a splitting field\nextension for $f$ if $f$ splits over $L$ and if there exists no proper\nsubfield of $L$ containing $K$ such that $f$ splits over that subfield.\nThe Exact Extension\nSuppose $L:K$ is an extension and $f \\in K[x]$ splits over $L$ as\n$f(x) = a(x-\\alpha_1)\\dots(x-\\alpha_n)$. Then\n$K(\\alpha_1, \\dots, \\alpha_n)$ is a splitting field extension for\n$f(x)$.\nSimple Extensions Mean Reducible\nSuppose $f \\in K[x]$ is irreducible of degree $n \\geq 1$. Then there\nexists a simple algebraic extension $K(\\alpha) : K$ such that\n$[K(\\alpha):K] = n$ and $f(\\alpha) = 0$ for some $\\alpha = L$.\nRandom Fact From Notes\nFor any prime $p$, there exists a field of order $p^n$ for any\n$n \\in \\mathbb N$.\nRoots of Unity and Cyclotomic Polynomials\nRoots of Unity\nLet $p(x) = x^n - 1$. Applying De Moivre's Theorem we find the complex\nroots to $p(x)$ to be\n$$\\frac{\\cos 2k\\pi}{n} + \\frac{i\\sin 2k\\pi}{n} = \\exp{\\frac{2\\pi ik}{n}}, 1 \\leq k \\leq n.$$\nWe can write these roots as $a, a^2, a^3, \\dots, a^{n-1}, a^n = 1$ for\n$a = \\exp{\\frac{2\\pi ik}{n}}$.\nRoots Make Group\nThe roots of unity form a cyclic group $C_n$ of order $n$. One can\npartition $C_n$ into $\\delta(n)$ classes, where two elements are the in\nsame class if and only if they have the same order in $C_n$.\nCyclotomic Polynomials\nThe $n^{th}$ cyclotomic polynomial $\\Phi_n(x)$ is defined as\n$$\\Phi_n(x) = \\prod_\\epsilon (x-\\alpha)$$ where the product is taken\nover all primitive $n^{th}$ roots of unity. As a consequence of\npartitioning $C_n$, it follows that $$x^n-1 = \\prod_{m|n}\\Phi_m(x).$$\nGalois Group of a Polynomial\nSet of Automorphisms\nLet $L : K$ be a field extension and let $\\Gamma(L:K)$ denote the set of\nall automorphisms $\\sigma$ of $L$ such that for all $x \\in K$,\n$\\sigma(x) = x$.

The distribution of a statistic is called a sampling\ndistribution.\nBias\nFor a parameter $\\theta$ and an estimator $\\hat \\theta$ for $\\theta$,\nthe estimator is unbias if and only if $E(\\hat \\theta) = \\theta$. We\nsay it is not unbias if $E(\\hat \\theta) \\neq \\theta$.

An interval\nestimator will likely contain the target parameter and will be\nrelatively narrow. This is also commonly called a confidence interval.\nConfidence Coefficient\nThe probability that a random confidence interval will enclose $\\theta$\nis called the confidence coefficient. This probability is denoted as\n$$P(\\hat \\theta_L \\leq \\theta \\leq \\hat \\theta_U) = 1 - \\alpha$$ where\n$\\hat \\theta_L$ and $\\hat \\theta_U$ are the lower and upper bounds on\nthe confidence interval defined as\n$$\\hat \\theta_L = \\hat \\theta - z_{\\alpha /2}\\sigma_{\\hat \\theta}$$\n$$\\hat \\theta_U = \\hat \\theta + z_{\\alpha /2}\\sigma_{\\hat \\theta}$$ and\n$(1-\\alpha)$ is the confidence coefficient.\nOne Sided Confidence Intervals\nIt is possible to build a one sided confidence interval such that\n$$P(\\hat \\theta_L \\leq \\theta) = 1 - \\alpha$$ or\n$$P(\\theta \\leq \\hat \\theta_U) = 1 - \\alpha.$$\nSignificance Level\nIf $(1-\\alpha)$ is the confidence coefficient, then $\\alpha$ is called\nthe significance level.\nConfidence Level\nIn the context of confidence interval, the $100(1 - \\alpha)%$ is called\nthe confidence level.\nMargin of Error\nThe margin of error is a value to determine how sample size affects\nthe accuracy of an estimated. It is calculated as half the length of the\nconfidence interval. It is also called the maximum error of the\nestimate.\nProperties of Point Estimators\nRelative Efficiency\nGiven two unbias estimators $\\hat \\theta_1$ and $\\hat \\theta_2$ of a\nparameter $\\theta$, then the efficiency of $\\hat \\theta_1$ relative to\n$\\hat \\theta_2$ is given by the following:\n$$\\mathit{eff}(\\hat \\theta_1, \\hat \\theta_2) = \\frac{V(\\hat \\theta_2)}{V(\\hat \\theta_1)}$$\nIf $\\mathit{eff}(\\hat \\theta_1, \\hat \\theta_2) &gt; 1$, then we prefer\n$\\hat \\theta_1$ as an estimator over $\\hat \\theta_2$.\nConsistency\nAn estimator $\\hat \\theta$ is said to be a consistent estimator of\n$\\theta$ if for any $\\epsilon &gt; 0$,\n$$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P(|\\hat \\theta_n - \\theta| &lt; \\epsilon) = 1$$\nor\n$$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} P(|\\hat \\theta_n - \\theta| \\geq \\epsilon) = 0.$$\nConsistency measures the variance of the estimator as the sample size\nincreases.\nConsistency of Unbias Estimators\nAn unbias estimator $\\hat \\theta$ is said to be a consistent estimator\nof $\\theta$ if $$\\lim_{n \\rightarrow \\infty} V(\\hat \\theta_n) = 0.$$\nLikelihood\nLet $y_1 = Y_1, y_2 = Y_2, \\dots, y_n = Y_n$ follow the distribution\nthat depends on parameter $\\theta$. If $Y_i$ are discrete random\nvariables then the likelihood function of the sample is\n$$L(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n, \\theta) = P(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n, \\theta) = \\prod{P(y_i)}$$\nOr if $Y_i$ are continuous random variables then the likelihood\nfunction of the sample is\n$$L(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n, \\theta) = f(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n, \\theta) = \\prod{f(y_i)}$$\nSometimes $L(\\theta)$ is used over $L(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n, \\theta)$.\nSufficiency\nThe statistic $U = g(Y_1,Y_2,\\dots,Y_n)$ is said to be a sufficient\nstatistic if the conditional distribution of $Y_i$ given $U$ does not\ndepend on parameter $\\theta$.\nMethod of Finding Sufficiency\nThe statistic $U = g(Y_1,Y_2,\\dots,Y_n)$ is sufficient if and only if\nthe likelihood function can be factored into 2 non-negative functions as\nfollows.\n$$L(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n, \\theta) = g(U,\\theta)\\cdot h(y_1, y_2, \\dots, y_n)$$\nRao-Blackwell Theorem\nLet $\\hat \\theta$ be an unbias estimator for $\\theta$ such that\n$V(\\hat \\theta) &lt; \\infty$. If $U$ is a sufficient statistic for\n$\\theta$, define $\\hat \\theta^* = E(\\theta|U)$.

Then, confirm if\nit is unbais. If not, tweat the estimator to make it unbais.\nMethods of Estimation\nMethod of Moments\n$k^{th}$ Moment of a Random Variable\nThe $k^{th}$ moment taken about the origin is defined as the\nfollowing: $$\\mu_k^\\prime = E(Y^k)$$\n$k^{th}$ Sample Moment\nThe $k^{th}$ sample moment of the sample $Y_1, Y_2,\\dots, Y_n$ is\ndefined as the following: $$m_k^\\prime = \\frac{\\sum{Y_i^k}}{n}$$\nMethod of Moments\nThe objective is to estimate $\\mu_k^\\prime$ with $m_k^\\prime$. For a\ndistribution of $t$ random variables, we set\n$\\mu_k^\\prime = \\mu_k^\\prime$ for $k \\in [1, t]$ and solve for\n$\\theta_1, \\theta_2, \\dots, \\theta_t$.\nMethod of Maximum Likelihood\nMaximum Likelihood Estimators\nMaximize $ln(L(\\theta))$ with respect to each parameter and solve for\nthe parameter. We call estimators found this way maximum likelihood\nestimators.\nHypothesis Testing\nDefinition\nA hypothesis test is a commonly used method for making a decision\nabout the value of a parameter by the data from samples.\nHypotheses\nA hypothesis test is based upon two hypotheses determined by the\nstatistician. The first is the null hypothesis, denoted by $H_0$,\nwhich is a statement of equality assumed to be true for the sake of the\ntest. The second is the alternative hypothesis, denoted $H_a$, which\nis a statement of inequality.\nParadigm\nHypothesis tests come to one of two conclusions. They can reject $H_0$,\nwhich shows the data would be in favor of $H_a$ and we conclude that\n$H_a$ is true. Or, they can fail to reject null, which shows the data is\nnot strong enough to support $H_a$ and we conclude that $H_0$ is true.\nTest Statistic\nThe test statistic is the sample statistic used to make a conclusion\non during a hypothesis test.\np-value\nThe p-value of a hypothesis test is the smallest level of significance\nfor which the observed data indicate that the null hypothesis should be\nrejected. It is the probability that the test statistic, or a value more\nextreme, would occur given the null hypothesis is true.\nConclusions\nAfter determining the p-value, the statistician can draw a conclusion to\nthe experiment based on a significance level. If $p-value \\leq \\alpha$,\nthen we reject the null hypothesis. Otherwise, if $p-value &gt; \\alpha$,\nthen we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\nHow to Perform a Hypothesis Test\n\n\nForm hypotheses\n\n\nChoose the significance level $\\alpha$\n\n\nUse sample data to determine the value of the test statistic\n\n\nUse a test to determine the p-value\n\n\nMake a decision about the truth of $H_0$\n\n\nTypes of Tests\nLet the null hypothesis be $H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0$. Then given the\nfollowing alternatives, we determine the tail of the test.\n\n\n$H_a: \\theta \\neq \\theta_0 \\rightarrow$ Two tailed test\n\n\n$H_a: \\theta &gt; \\theta_0 \\rightarrow$ Right tailed test\n\n\n$H_a: \\theta &lt; \\theta_0 \\rightarrow$ Left tailed test\n\n\nError Analysis\nType I Error\nA type I error occurs when the result of a hypothesis test concludes\nto reject $H_0$, when in reality that conclusion is false, and the $H_0$\nis true. The probability of a type I error is the significance level:\n$P(\\text{Type I Error}) = \\alpha$.\nType II Error\nA type II error occurs when the result of a hypothesis test fails to\nreject $H_0$, when in reality that conclusion is false, and the $H_0$ is\nfalse. The probability of a type II error is based on the size of the\nsample size: $P(\\text{Type II Error}) = \\beta$.\nDecisions Made in a Hypothesis Test\n $H_0$ True$H_0$ False\nFail to reject $H_0$Type I Error\nReject $H_0$Type II Error\n\nPower of Tests\nDefinition\nSuppose $W$ is a test statistic and $RR$ be the rejection region for a\nhypothesis test of parameter $\\theta$. Define the power of the test,\ndenoted $power(\\theta)$, to be the probability that the test rejects\n$H_0$, when the actual value parameter value is $\\theta$. In other\nwords, $$power(\\theta) = P(\\text{Reject } H_0 : \\theta = \\theta_0)$$\nwhere $\\theta_0$ is the value of the null hypothesis. Analyzing the\npower of a test is contrasts the p-value approach to statistical tests.\nPower When Null Is True\nSuppose $\\theta = \\theta_0$. Then $$\\begin{aligned}\npower(\\theta_0) &amp;= P(\\text{Reject } H_0 : H_0 \\text{ is true}) \\\n&amp;= P(\\text{Type I error}) \\\n&amp;= \\alpha\\end{aligned}$$\nPower When Null Is False\nSuppose $\\theta = \\theta_a$. Then $$\\begin{aligned}\npower(\\theta_a) &amp;= P(\\text{Reject } H_0 : H_0 \\text{ is false}) \\\n&amp;= 1 - P(\\text{Fail to reject } H_0 : H_0 \\text{ is false}) \\\n&amp;= 1 - P(\\text{Type II error}) \\\n&amp;= 1 - \\beta\\end{aligned}$$\nPower Curve\nLooks kind of like 1 minus the normal distribution, with the minimum\nvalue at $\\theta_0$ having height of $\\alpha$.\nSimple Hypothesis\nIf a random sample is taken from a distribution of parameter $\\theta$, a\nhypothesis is said to be simple if that hypothesis uniquely identifies\nthe distribution.\nComposite Hypothesis\nAny hypothesis that is not simple is called composite and does not\nuniquely identify the distribution.\nMost Powerful Test\nWhen determining the value of $H_0$ and $H_a$, we want to choose a\nrejection region such that $\\alpha = power(\\theta_0)$ is fixed and\n$power(\\theta_a)$ is maximum. We call such a test the most powerful\ntest.\nNeymann-Pearson Lemma\nSuppose we test simple null hypothesis $H_0: \\theta = \\theta_0$ versus\nsimple alternative hypothesis $H_a: \\theta = \\theta_a$, based on simple\nrandom samples $Y_1,\\dots, Y_n$ from a distribution with parameter\n$\\theta$. Then for a given $\\alpha$, the test that maximizes the power\nat $\\theta_a$ has a rejection region $RR$ determined by\n$$\\frac{L(\\theta_0)}{L(\\theta_a)} &lt; k$$ where $k$ is chosen so that the\ntest has a desired value for $\\alpha$. Note that $k$ is a bound on the\nrandom variable $Y$.\nUniformly Most Powerful Test\nThe Neymann-Pearson Lemma can only be used on a simple alternative\nhypothesis. Oftentimes a composite alternative hypothesis is used. In\norder to invoke the Neymann-Pearson Lemma, we say $H_a = \\theta_a$ for\n$\\theta_a$ in the bounds described by the composite alternative\nhypothesis. When this procedure is used on a test with a composite\nalternative hypothesis, the determined $\\alpha$ gives the uniformly\nmost powerful test.\nAnalysis of Categorical Data\nTypes of Data\nAll of data can be either quantitative or qualitative. Quantitative\ndata are numbers, that are either discrete or continuous.\nQualitative data are not numbers, but are categories or qualities of an\nobservational unit. There is monimal data, where the variables are not\nordered, and ordinal, where the variables have a natural way of being\nordered.\nContingency Table\nWhen data is collected from two variables of a population it is called\nbi-variate. When the frequency of the two variables are drawn across\neach other we call this a contingency table.\nAnalysis of Variance\nFactor and Level\nVariables that the statistician uses to partition the population into\nsubpopulations are called factors. A distinct subcategory of a factor\nis called its level.\nANOVA\nThe analysis of variance (abbreviated ANOVA) is a procedure that\nattempts to analyze the variation in a set of responses and assign\nportions of this variation to each variable in a set of independent\nvariables. The objective is to identify important independent variables\nand determine how they affect the response.\nExperimental Units\nObjects upon which measurements are taken are called experimental\nunits.\nBlocks and Treatments\nWays to partition data is into factor variables blocks and\ntreatments. Generally data is partitioned into blocks are treatments\nare then applied to each block. Mathematically, how this assignment is\ndone is arbitrary.\nCompletely Randomized Design\nA completely randomized design to compare $k$ treatments, is one in\nwhich a grup of $n$ relatively homogeneous experimental units are\nrandomly divided into $k$ subgroups of sizes $n_1, n_2, \\dots, n_k$\nwhere the sum of $n_i$ is $n$. All experimental units in each subgroup\nreceive the same treatment, which each treatment applied to exactly one\nsubgroup.\nRandomized Block Design\nA randomized block design containing $b$ blocks $k$ treatments\nconsists of $b$ blocks of $k$ experimental units each. The treatments\nare randomly assigned units in each block, with each treatments\nappearing exactly once in every block.\nWays to Measure Variance for Two Way ANOVA\nTotal Sum of Squares\nThe sum of squares of deviations or total sum of squares,\nabbreviated TSS, is a measure of variance across the entire\npopulation. It's value is calculated by the following:\n$$TSS = \\sum_{i=1}^k \\sum_{j=1}^{n_i} (y_{ij} - \\bar y)^2$$\nError Sum of Squares\nThe error sum of squares, abbreviated SSE is a measure of variation\nwithin subpopulations partitioned by treatments.\nTreatment Sum of Squares\nThe error sum of squares, abbreviated SSE is a measure of variation\nbetween subpopulations partitioned by treatments.\nBayesian Statistics\nParadigm\nUp to this point in these notes, all statistical procedures are based on\ntreating parameters as unknown constants. Bayesian statistics treats\nparameters as random variables that follow a distribution. Using data\ncollected, we can adjust the distribution to be more accurate given the\ndata using Bayes' Rule.\nBayes' Rule\nLet $A$ and $B$ be two events with probability $P(A)$ and $P(B)$. Then\nthe following is true, given that $P(B) \\neq 0$.\n$$P(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A)\\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}$$\nDiscrete Probabilities\nLet $H$ be an outcome of the given parameter and let $D$ be the data\ncollected about that parameter.\n\n\nEvery parameter starts with an initial distribution. We call this\nthe prior distribution notated as $P(H)$.\n\n\nThe likelihood is the probability that the data occurs given the\nprior distribution, notated as $P(D|H)$.\n\n\nThe probability that the data occurs is called the marginal\ndistribution notated as $P(D)$.\n\n\nLastly, the distribution of the parameter given the collected data\nis called the posterior distribution, notated as $P(H|D)$.\n\n\nIn addition, we call an intermediate calculation the joint likelihood,\ncalculated by $P(H)\\cdot P(D|H)$.\nHow to Calculate Posterior Distribution\nUsing Bayes' rule, we can calculate the posterior distribution using the\nprior distribution and the data. First calculate likelihood, then joint\nlikelihood. The sum of the all joint likelihoods is the marginal\ndistribution. Then using Bayes' rule the posterior is calculated.\nBayesian Box\nA Bayesian box is a way to organize calculations taken to determine\nthe posterior probability. Is is shown here.\nHypothesesPriorLikelihoodJointPosterior\n$H_1$$P(H_1)$$P(DH_1)$$P(H_1) \\cdot P(D\n$H_2$$P(H_2)$$P(DH_2)$$P(H_2) \\cdot P(D\n$\\vdots$$\\vdots$$\\vdots$$\\vdots$$\\vdots$\n$H_2$$P(H_2)$$P(DH_2)$$P(H_2) \\cdot P(D\n$Total:$$1$$P(D)$$1$\n\nContinuous Probabilities\nThis is similar to the discrete counterpart, adjusted for continuous\nrandom variables. Let $\\theta$ be the value of the given parameter and\nlet $y_1, \\dots, y_n$ be the data collected about that parameter.\n\n\nWe notate the prior distribution as $g(\\theta)$.\n\n\nThe likelihood of the data is the application of the likelihood\nfunction, $L(y_1, \\dots, y_n | \\theta)$.\n\n\nThe joint distribution is calculated by\n$L(y_1, \\dots, y_n | \\theta) \\cdot g(\\theta)$.\n\n\nThe marginal distribution is calculated as follows:\n$$m(y_1, \\dots, y_n) = \\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty L(y_1, \\dots, y_n | \\theta) \\cdot g(\\theta)\\ d\\theta$$\n\n\nLastly, the posterior distribution is calculated as follows:\n$$g^*(\\theta|y_1, \\dots, y_n) = \\frac{L(y_1, \\dots, y_n | \\theta) \\cdot g(\\theta)}{\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty L(y_1, \\dots, y_n | \\theta) \\cdot g(\\theta)\\ d\\theta}$$\n\n\nBernoulli Distribution\nA discrete random variable that has binary outcomes 0 or 1 follows a\nBernoulli distribution with probability function as follows:\n$$f(k) = p^k(1-p)^{1-k}$$\nBeta Distribution\nIn Bayesian statistics, any beta distribution is the prior distribution\nfor a Bernoulli or Binomial distribution. When the prior is updated\nusing the data, the result is a beta posterior was altered parameter\nvalues.\nConjugate Prior\nAny prior distributions that result in posterior distributions that\nfollow the same functional form of the prior are called conjugate\npriors.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/stats/theory/","title":"Statistical Theory"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cs/":{"body":0,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/cs/alg/":{"body":998,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/math/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/math/groups/":{"body":1785,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/math/real/":{"body":2308,"title":2},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/math/rings-fields/":{"body":2626,"title":3},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/stats/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/stats/theory/":{"body":2105,"title":2}},"length":8}};
