We also say $f$ is one-to-one.\nSurjectivity\nLet $f$ be surjective if for all elements in the codomain, there\nexists an element in the domain that maps to it. We also say $f$ is\nonto.\nBijectivity\nLet $f$ be bijective if it is both injective and surjective.\nEquivalence Relations\nDefinition\nLet $a$ be related $b$, denoted $a \\sim b$ .

In other words, the left and right cancellation laws exists\nfor groups: $$au = av \\implies u = v$$ $$ub = vb \\implies u = v$$\nOrder\nThe order of an element $x$ is the smallest positive integer $n$ such\nthat\n$$x^n = \\underbrace{x \\cdot x \\cdot x \\cdot \\dots \\cdot x}_\\text{n elements} = e$$\nIf does not exist a finite $n$, then the element has infinite order.\nThe order of $x$ is also denoted $|x|$. The order of a group is the\ncardinality of the set.\nSubgroups\nDefinition\nA subset $H$ of a group $G$ is a subgroup of $G$ if it closed under\nthe binary operation of $G$ and satisfies the axioms to be a group under\nthe binary operation of $G$.\nHow to prove $H$ is a subgroup\n$H$ is a subgroup of $G$ if for any $h, k \\in H$, then $h \\cdot k \\in H$\nand $e \\in H$.\nDihedral Groups\nDefinition\nThe dihedral group $D_{ 2n}$ is a group of symmetries of an $n$-sided\nregular polygon. Formally we express this group in group presentation\nas follows:\n$$D_{2n} = \\langle r, s : r^n = s^2 = 1, rs = sr^{-1}\\rangle$$\nHow to Identify\nUsing the following steps, we can identify if a group of is a dihedral\ngroup:\n\n\n$1, r, r^2, \\dots, r^{n-1}$ are distinct; $r^n = 1$\n\n\n$s^2 = 1$\n\n\n$s \\neq r^i, \\forall i$\n\n\n$sr^i \\neq sr^j, \\forall i, j$\n\n\n$rs = sr^{-1}$\n\n\n$r^is = sr^{-i}$\n\n\nSymmetric Groups\nDefinition\nLet $\\Omega = \\{1, 2, \\dots, n\\}$. Let $S_n$ be the set of all\nbijections from $\\Omega$ to itself, or in other words, the set of all\npermutations of $\\Omega$. Then we call $S_n$ a symmetric group of\ndegree $n$. Note that the order of $S_n$ is $n!$.\nCycle Decomposition\nLet the cycle decomposition of an element of $S_n$ be the composition\nof cycles. A cycle is a string of integers $(a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_m)$\nsuch that $a_i \\mapsto a_{i+1}$ and $a_m \\mapsto a_1$. By convention, we\ndo not write cycles such as $(a_i)$, in other words when\n$a_i \\mapsto a_i$, as it is implied.\nLength\nThe length of a cycle is number of integers within it.\nDisjoint Cycles\nTwo cycles are called disjoint if there are no integers in common.\nDisjoint cycles commute.\nQuarternions\nDefinition\nWe define the Quartenions as the group represented by the following\ngroup representation: \n$$\\begin{aligned} Q_8 = \\langle &amp;1, -1, i, -i, j, -j, k, -k : \\\\ &amp;i^2 = j^2 = k^2 = -1, \\\\ &amp;-1 \\cdot a = a \\cdot -1 = -a, \\forall a \\in Q_8, \\\\ &amp;i \\cdot j = k, j \\cdot k = i, k \\cdot i = j, j \\cdot i = -k, k \\cdot j = -i, i \\cdot k = -j \\rangle\\end{aligned}$$ \nIsomorphisms\nHomomorphism\nLet $(G, \\bullet), (H, \\circ)$ be groups and $x,y \\in G$. Then\n$\\varphi: G \\rightarrow H$ is a homomorphism if\n$$\\varphi(x \\bullet y) = \\varphi(x) \\circ \\varphi(y).$$ Shorthand\nnotations is used where the operations are omitted and implied.\nIsomorphism\nLet $\\varphi: G \\rightarrow H$ be an isomorphism if and only if\n$\\varphi$ is both a homomorphism and a bijection. If there exists a\nisomorpism between groups $G$ and $H$ then we say those groups are\nisomorphic.\nOrder\nIf $\\varphi: G \\rightarrow H$ is an isomorphism, then\n$|\\varphi(x)| = |x|$.\nSmall Order Group Structure\nGroups of Order 1\nAll groups of order 1 are of the form $(\\{e\\}, \\circ)$. This is also\ncalled the trivial group.\nGroups of Order 2\nAll groups of order 2 are of the form $(\\{e, a\\}, \\circ)$ such that\n$a^2 = 1$.\nGroups of Order 3\nAll groups of order 3 are of the form $(\\{e, a, b\\}, \\circ)$ such that\n$a^{-1} = b$.\nGroups of Order 4\nAll groups of order 4 are of the form $(\\{e, a, b, c\\}, \\circ)$ such\nthat either $a^{-1} = b$ and $c^2 = 1$, which is isomorphic to\n$\\mathbb{Z}/n\\mathbb{Z}$ or $a^2 = b^2 = c^2 = e$, which is isomorphic\nto $(\\mathbb Z/n\\mathbb Z)^\\times$.\nCommutivity\nAll groups of order 4 or less are abelian.\nGroup Actions\nDefinition\nA group action is a map from $G \\times A \\rightarrow A$ satisfying the\nfollowing:\n\n\n$g_1 \\cdot (g_2 \\cdot a) = (g_1 \\cdot g_2) \\cdot a$\n\n\n$e_G \\cdot a = a \\cdot e_G = a$\n\n\nWe say that $G$ acts on $A$.\nTrivial Action\nThe trivial group action is $g \\cdot a \\mapsto a$ for all\n$g \\in G, a \\in A$.\nFaith\nA group action is called faithful if it maps every element of $G$ to a\nunique permutation of $A$.\nKernal\nThe kernal of the action of $G$ onto $A$ is defined as\n$$\\{g \\in G : g \\cdot a = a, \\forall a \\in A\\}$$\nOrbit\nThe orbit of an element $a \\in A$ under the action of $G$, is every\nelement in $A$ obtained by an element of $g$ acting on $a$, as follows:\n$$G\\cdot a = \\{b \\in A : g \\cdot a = b \\text{ for some } g \\in G\\}$$\nSubgroups\nReview\nAlternate Definition\nA subset of $H$ of group $G$ is a subgroup if and only if\n\n\n$H \\neq \\emptyset$\n\n\n$\\forall x,y \\in H, xy^{-1} \\in H$\n\n\nWe will donate $H$ as a proper subgroup of $G$ as $H &lt; G$.\nTransitivity\nIf $H &lt; K$ and $K &lt; G$ then $H &lt; G$.\nNotable Subgroups\nCentralizer\nDefine the centralizer of $A$ in $G$ to be the following:\n$$C_G(A) = \\{g \\in G : ga = ag, \\forall a \\in A\\}$$\nCenter\nDefine the center of group $G$ to be the following:\n$$Z(G) = \\{g \\in G : gx = xg, \\forall x \\in G\\}$$\nNormalizer\nDefine the normalizer of $A$ in $G$ to be the following:\n$$N_G(A) = \\{g \\in G : gAg^{-1} = A\\}$$ such that\n$$gAg^{-1} = \\{gag^{-1} : a \\in A\\}$$\nStabilizer\nLet $G$ be a group acting on a set $S$. Define the stabilizer of\n$s \\in G$ for some fixed $s \\in S$ to be the following:\n$$G_S = \\{g\\in G : g \\cdot s = s\\}$$\nCyclic Groups\nGenerator\nA generator $\\langle x \\rangle$ is defined as the following:\n$$\\langle x \\rangle = \\{x^n : n \\in \\mathbb Z\\}$$ We say the set\n$\\langle x \\rangle$ is generated by $x$.\nCyclic Group\nA group $H$ is cyclic if $H$ can be generated by a single element.\nCountable\nAll cyclic groups are either finite or countably infinite.\nAbelian\nCyclic groups are abelian.\nCyclic Groups of Equal Order\nIf two cyclic groups have the same order, then they are isomorphic.\nSubgroups of Cyclic Groups\nLet $H = \\langle x \\rangle$ be a cyclic group.

Then the set elements of the cosets that solve\n$$uK \\circ vK = (uv)K$$ forms the quotient group $G/K$.\nCoset Factoring\nThe property that $uK \\circ vK = (uv)K$ is well defined if and only if\n$gng^{-1} \\in N$ for all $g\\in G, n \\in N$.\nNormal Subgroups\nFor $N \\leq G$, $N$ is normal if every element normalizes $G$. That is\nthat $gNg^{-1} = N$ for all $g \\in G$. We write $N \\trianglelefteq G$.\nEquivalent Statements on Normality\nThe following are equivalent:\n\n\n$N \\trianglelefteq G$\n\n\n$N_G(N) = G$\n\n\n$gN = Ng$ for all $g \\in G$\n\n\nThe operation on the set of left cosets of $N$ is a subgroup\n\n\n$gNg^{-1} \\subseteq N$ for all $g \\in G$\n\n\nSimple Groups\nLagrange’s Theorem Again\nThe cardinality of any subgroup of $G$ divides the cardinality of $G$\nand the number of left cosets of the subgroup is their quotient if $G$\nis finite.\nIndex\nThe index of a subgroup $H$ is the number of cosets of $H$ in $G$.

Then $AB$ is a\nsubgroup of $G$, $B \\trianglelefteq AB$, $A\\cap B \\trianglelefteq A$,\nand $AB/B \\cong A/A\\cap B$.\nThe Third Isomorphism Theorem\nLet $H \\trianglelefteq G, K \\trianglelefteq G$ where $H \\leq K$. Then\n$K/H \\trianglelefteq G/H$ and $(G/H)/(K/H) \\cong (G/K)$.\nThe Holder Program\nA Weak Cauchy’s Theorem\nIf $G$ is a finite abelian group and $p$ is a prime dividing $|G|$, then\n$G$ contains an element of order $p$.\nThe Holder Program\nThe goal of the Holder Program is to classify all finite simple groups\nand to find ways of putting the simple groups together to form other\ngroups.\nThe Classifications of Finite Simple Groups\nThere are 18 infinite families of simple groups and 26 simple groups\nthat do not belong to these such that every finite simple group is\nisomorphic to a group in the list.\nThe Alternating Group\nTransposition\nA transposition is a 2-cycle.\nA Parity Function\nDefine the function $\\epsilon : S_n \\rightarrow \\{\\pm 1\\}$ to be the\nfollowing: $$\\epsilon(\\sigma) = \\begin{cases}\n1, &amp;\\text{if $\\sigma$ is the product of even number of transpositions} \\\n-1, &amp;\\text{if $\\sigma$ is the product of odd number of transpositions}\n\\end{cases}$$ We call the output of $\\epsilon$ the sign of $\\sigma$.\nThe Alternating Group\nThe alternating group $A_n$ is the subgroup of even permutations of\n$S_n$.\nNormal and Simple\nThe alternating group $A_n$ is normal in $S_n$ and is simple for\n$n \\geq 5$.\nGroup Actions\nRevisit\nDefinition\nA group action is a homomorphism from a group $G$ to the symmetric\ngroup of a set $A$. We say that $G$ acts on $A$.\nOrbit\nLet $a \\in A$ such that $G$ acts on $A$, then the orbit of $a$ is the\nimage of all elements in $G$ acting on $a$:\n$$O_a = \\{b \\in A : g \\cdot a = b, \\forall g \\in G\\}$$\nCayley’s Theorem\nEvery group is isomorphic to the subgroup of a symmetric group. Note\nthat this isn’t necessarily the smallest group.\nOrbit-Stabilizer Theorem\nLet $G$ act on $A$ and let $x \\in A$. Then the size of the orbit of $x$\nis the same as the index of the stabilizer of $x$: $$|O_x| = |G:G_x|$$\nTransitivity\nA group acts transitively if there is only one orbit induced by the\naction.\nConjugacy\nDefinition\nTwo elements $a,b$ are called conjugate to each other if there exists\nsome $x \\in G$ such that $$xax{^{-1}}= b.$$\nConjugacy Classes\nElements that are conjugate to each other are part of the same\nconjugacy class. The orbits of the conjugation action of a group onto\nitself are also the conjugacy classes of that group. Conjugacy classes\npartition the group. The identity is always in its own conjugacy class.\nConjugate Permutations\nTwo elements in $S_n$ are conjugate if and only if they have the same\ncycle structure, or the same number of cycles of a given length.\nClass Equation\nThe following is true for a group $G$:\n$$|G| = |Z(G)| + \\sum_{i=1}^r[G:C_G(g_i)]$$\nSylow Theorems\n$p$-group\nIf $|G| = p^\\alpha$ for some prime $p$ then $G$ is called a $p$-group.\n$p$-subgroup\nIf a subgroup of a group is a $p$-group, then it is called a\n$p$-subgroup. Note that it does not necessarily need to be a subgroup\nof a $p$-group.\nSylow $p$-subgroup\nIf a $p$-subgroup has order $p^\\alpha$ such that $|G| = p^\\alpha m$\nwhere $p$ does not divide $m$, then we call this a Sylow $p$-subgroup.\nSylow Theorem\nLet $G$ be a group of order $p^\\alpha m$ where $p$ is prime,\n$\\alpha &gt; 0$, and $p$ does not divide $m$. Define $n_p$ to be the number\nof Sylow $p$-subgroups. Then the following are true.\n\n\nGroup $G$ contains a Sylow $p$-subgroup.\n\n\nAny two Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugate.\n\n\nWhere $P$ is any Sylow $p$-subgroup, then $n_p \\equiv 1 \\pmod p$ and\n$n_p = [G~:~N_G(P)]$.\n\n\nUnique Sylow $p$-subgroup\nIf $H$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ for some prime $p$, then\n$H$ is normal in $G$.\nFinitely Generated Abelian Groups\nFinitely Generated Group\nA group is finitely generated if $G = \\langle A \\rangle$ where\n$|A| = n &lt; \\infty$.\nFundamental Theorem of Finitely Generated Abelian Groups\nIf $G$ is a finitely generated abelian group, then\n$$G \\cong \\mathbb Z^r \\times Z_{n_1} \\times Z_{n_2} \\times \\dots \\times Z_{n_s}$$\nfor integers $r \\geq 0$, $n_i \\geq 2$, and $n_{j+1}$ divides $n_j$ for\n$1 \\leq j \\leq s - 1$. This expression is unique. Thus, every finitely\ngenerated abelian group is the product of cyclic groups.\n","id":"http://127.0.0.1:1111/math/groups/","title":"Group Theory"}},"docInfo":{"http://127.0.0.1:1111/math/":{"body":0,"title":1},"http://127.0.0.1:1111/math/groups/":{"body":1785,"title":2}},"length":2}};
